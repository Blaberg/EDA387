The listening address is bound to the IPv4 adress 0.0.0.0 and listening on socket 5703. 0.0.0.0 is a non-routable
meta-address used to designate an invalid, unknown, or non-applicable target (a ‘no particular address’ place holder).
When this is applied to a server, this is meant to mean "all IPv4 addresses on the local machine".
